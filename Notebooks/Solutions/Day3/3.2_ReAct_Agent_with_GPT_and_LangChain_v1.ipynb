As of 1 January 2025, 66,352,000 people lived in Metropolitan France, while 2,254,000 lived in overseas France, for a total of 68,606,000 inhabitants in the French Republic. In January 2022, the population of France officially reached the 68,000,000 mark. In the 2010s and until 2017, the population of France grew by 1 million people every three years - an average annual increase of 340,000 people, or +0.6%.\n","France was historically Europe's most populous country. During the Middle Ages, more than one-quarter of Europe's total population was French; by the seventeenth century, this had decreased slightly to one-fifth. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, other European countries, such as Germany and Russia, had caught up with France and overtaken it in number of people. The country's population sharply increased with the baby boom following World War II, as it did in other European countries.\n","According to INSEE, from the year 2004, 200,000 immigrants entered the country annually. One out of two was born in Europe and one in three in Africa. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of Europeans migrating to France increased sharply (an annual increase of 12%), but this percentage decreased steadily until 2022, supplanted by a rise in the number of immigrants from Africa.\n","The national birth rate, after dropping for a time, began to rebound in the 1990s, and the country's fertility rate was close to the replacement level until about 2014. According to a 2006 INSEE study, the natural increase was close to 300,000 people a year, a level that had \"not been reached in more than thirty years.\" With a total fertility rate of 1.59 (for France métropolitaine) in 2024, France remains one of the above-average fertile countries in the European Union, but it is now far from the replacement level.\n","In 2021, the total fertility rate of France was 1.82, and 7.7% was the percentage of births, where this was a women's 4th or more child.\n","Among the 802,000 babies born in metropolitan France in 2010, 80.1% had two French parents, 13.3% had one French parent, and 6.6% had two non-French parents.\n","Between 2006 and 2008, about 22% of newborns in France had at least one foreign-born grandparent (9% born in another European country, 8% born in the Maghreb and 2% born in another region of the world). Censuses on race and ethnic origin were banned by the French government in 1978.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Population of Canada\n","Summary: Canada ranks 37th by population among countries of the world, comprising about 0.5% of the world's total, with about 41.5 million Canadians as of 2025. Despite being the second-largest country by total area (fourth-largest by land area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north. Just over 60 percent of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. Though Canada's overall population density is low, many regions in the south, such as the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, have population densities higher than several European countries. Canada has six population centres with more than one million people: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.\n","The large size of Canada's north, which is currently not arable, and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the country's carrying capacity. In 2021, the population density of Canada was 4.2 people per square kilometre.\n","The historical growth of Canada's population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as Indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Immigration has been, and remains, the most important factor in Canada's population growth. The 2021 Canadian census counted a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of aroun\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI need to calculate the square of the population of France.\n","Action: Calculator\n","Action Input: 68606000 ** 2\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3m4706783236000000\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer\n","Final Answer: 4,706,783,236,000,000\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\n","======================================================================\n","✅ Final Answer: 4,706,783,236,000,000\n","======================================================================\n"]}],"source":["# Run the agent with a complex question\n","question = \"What is the population of France squared?\"\n","\n","print(f\"\\n{'='*70}\")\n","print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n","print(f\"{'='*70}\\n\")\n","\n","result = agent_executor.invoke({\"input\": question})\n","\n","print(f\"\\n{'='*70}\")\n","print(f\"✅ Final Answer: {result['output']}\")\n","print(f\"{'='*70}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qdDH5BINSBJW"},"source":["---\n","## 📊 Part 9: Understanding the Agent's Process\n","\n","Let's examine what happened:\n","\n","### The ReAct Pattern\n","\n","The agent followed this pattern:\n","\n","1. **Thought**: \"I need to find the population of France first\"\n","2. **Action**: Wikipedia\n","3. **Action Input**: \"France population\"\n","4. **Observation**: [Wikipedia result with population]\n","5. **Thought**: \"Now I need to square this number\"\n","6. **Action**: Calculator\n","7. **Action Input**: \"[population] ** 2\"\n","8. **Observation**: [Calculation result]\n","9. **Thought**: \"I now know the final answer\"\n","10. **Final Answer**: [Result]\n","\n","### Key Advantages of LangChain\n","\n","- **No manual prompt engineering**: LangChain uses proven prompts\n","- **Automatic parsing**: No need to write regex parsers\n","- **Error handling**: Built-in error recovery\n","- **Extensibility**: Easy to add more tools\n","- **Production-ready**: Battle-tested in real applications"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rrLdNwFmSBJW"},"source":["---\n","## 🎯 Part 10: Try Your Own Questions!\n","\n","Now it's your turn!

It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and is seventh-largest country by area in the continent. The area of Germany ranked 63rd and covers 357,600 km2 (138,070 sq mi), consisting of 349,250 km2 (134,846 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq mi) of waters, smaller than Japan but larger than the Republic of the Congo.\n","Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,962 metres (9,718 ft)) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at 3.54 metres (11.6 ft) below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major rivers such as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe.\n","Germany has the second-most borders of any European country, after Russia. It shares borders with nine countries: Denmark in the north, Poland and the Czech Republic in the east, Switzerland (its only non-EU neighbor) and Austria in the south, France in the southwest and Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in the west. Germany also shares a maritime border with Sweden in the north and the United Kingdom in the northwest.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: States of Germany\n","Summary: The Federal Republic of Germany is a federation and consists of sixteen partly sovereign states (German: Länder, sing. Land). Of the 16 states, 13 are so-called \"area-states\" (Flächenländer); in these, below the level of the state government, there is a division into local authorities (counties and county-level cities) that have their own administration. Two states, Berlin and Hamburg, are city-states, in which there is no separation between state government and local administration. The state of Bremen is a special case: the state consists of the cities of Bremen, for which the state government also serves as the municipal administration, and Bremerhaven, which has its own local administration separate from the state government. It is therefore a mixture of a city-state and an area-state.\n","Three states, Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia, use the appellation Freistaat (\"free state\"); this title is merely stylistic and carries no legal or political significance (similar to the US states that call themselves a commonwealth).\n","The Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\") was created in 1949 through the unification of the three western zones previously under American, British, and French administration in the aftermath of World War II. Initially, the states of the Federal Republic were Baden (until 1952), Bavaria (Bayern), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (Hessen), Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen), North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen), Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz), Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden (until 1952), and Württemberg-Hohenzollern (until 1952). West Berlin, while still under occupation by the Western Allies, viewed itself as part of the Federal Republic and was largely integrated and considered a de facto state. In 1952, following a referendum, Baden, Württemberg-Baden, and Württemberg-Hohenzollern merged into Baden-Württemberg. In 1957, the Saar Protectorate joined the Federal Republic as the state of Saarland.\n","The next major change occurred with German reunification in 1990, in which the territory of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) became part of the Federal Republic, by accession of the re-established eastern states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), Saxony (Sachsen), Saxony-Anhalt (Sachsen-Anhalt), and Thuringia (Thüringen), and the reunification of West and East Berlin into a city state.

population\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Demographics of France\n","Summary: The demography of France is monitored by the Institut national d'études démographiques (INED) and the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (INSEE). As of 1 January 2025, 66,352,000 people lived in Metropolitan France, while 2,254,000 lived in overseas France, for a total of 68,606,000 inhabitants in the French Republic. In January 2022, the population of France officially reached the 68,000,000 mark. In the 2010s and until 2017, the population of France grew by 1 million people every three years - an average annual increase of 340,000 people, or +0.6%.\n","France was historically Europe's most populous country. During the Middle Ages, more than one-quarter of Europe's total population was French; by the seventeenth century, this had decreased slightly to one-fifth. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, other European countries, such as Germany and Russia, had caught up with France and overtaken it in number of people. The country's population sharply increased with the baby boom following World War II, as it did in other European countries.\n","According to INSEE, from the year 2004, 200,000 immigrants entered the country annually. One out of two was born in Europe and one in three in Africa. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of Europeans migrating to France increased sharply (an annual increase of 12%), but this percentage decreased steadily until 2022, supplanted by a rise in the number of immigrants from Africa.\n","The national birth rate, after dropping for a time, began to rebound in the 1990s, and the country's fertility rate was close to the replacement level until about 2014. According to a 2006 INSEE study, the natural increase was close to 300,000 people a year, a level that had \"not been reached in more than thirty years.\" With a total fertility rate of 1.59 (for France métropolitaine) in 2024, France remains one of the above-average fertile countries in the European Union, but it is now far from the replacement level.\n","In 2021, the total fertility rate of France was 1.82, and 7.7% was the percentage of births, where this was a women's 4th or more child.\n","Among the 802,000 babies born in metropolitan France in 2010, 80.1% had two French parents, 13.3% had one French parent, and 6.6% had two non-French parents.\n","Between 2006 and 2008, about 22% of newborns in France had at least one foreign-born grandparent (9% born in another European country, 8% born in the Maghreb and 2% born in another region of the world). Censuses on race and ethnic origin were banned by the French government in 1978.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Population of Canada\n","Summary: Canada ranks 37th by population among countries of the world, comprising about 0.5% of the world's total, with about 41.5 million Canadians as of 2025. Despite being the second-largest country by total area (fourth-largest by land area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north. Just over 60 percent of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. Though Canada's overall population density is low, many regions in the south, such as the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, have population densities higher than several European countries. Canada has six population centres with more than one million people: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.\n","The large size of Canada's north, which is currently not arable, and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the country's carrying capacity. In 2021, the population density of Canada was 4.2 people per square kilometre.\n","The historical growth of Canada's population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as Indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Immigration has been, and remains, the most important factor in Canada's population growth. The 2021 Canadian census counted a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of aroun\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe population of France is 68,606,000 as of 2025.\n","Final Answer: 68,606,000\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\n","Answer 1: 68,606,000\n","\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI should use the Calculator tool to find the square of the number.\n","Action: Calculator\n","Action Input: 12 ** 2\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3m144\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer\n","Final Answer: 144\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\n","Answer 2: 144\n"]}],"source":["# First question\n","result1 = executor_with_memory.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the population of France?\"})\n","print(f\"\\nAnswer 1: {result1['output']}\\n\")\n","\n","# Follow-up question (uses memory)\n","result2 = executor_with_memory.invoke({\"input\": \"What is that number squared?\"})\n","print(f\"\\nAnswer 2: {result2['output']}\")"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
