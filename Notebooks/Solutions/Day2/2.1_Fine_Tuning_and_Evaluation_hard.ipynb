    "# Semantic Search: Baseline vs Fine-Tuning Comparison (Hard Corpus)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Compare semantic search quality before and after fine-tuning using three approaches, but with a more challenging corpus and queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline**: Embedding search with FAISS (no fine-tuning)\n",
    "2. **Contrastive Fine-Tuning**: Improve embeddings directly using contrastive learning\n",
    "3. **LoRA Reranking**: Train a lightweight LoRA adapter on a small LLM to rerank FAISS results\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate each approach using standard information retrieval metrics:\n",
    "- **Hit@K**: Did we find at least one relevant document in the top K results?\n",
    "- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: How high is the first relevant result ranked?\n",
    "- **nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: How well are relevant documents ranked overall?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we'll test how each approach affects **downstream LLM performance** by using retrieved documents as context for question answering."

    "Traditional keyword search matches exact words, but **semantic search** understands the *meaning* behind queries and documents. For example:\n",
    "- Query: \"Who discovered the first antibiotic?\"\n",
    "- Relevant document: \"Alexander Fleming found penicillin in 1928\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Embedding**\n",
    "- Convert text into dense vectors (arrays of numbers) that capture semantic meaning\n",
    "- Similar meanings → similar vectors (close in vector space)\n",
    "- Example: \"dog\" and \"puppy\" have similar embeddings, but \"dog\" and \"car\" don't\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Indexing**\n",
    "- Store all document embeddings in a searchable index (we use FAISS)\n",
    "- FAISS enables fast similarity search over millions of vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Retrieval**\n",
    "- Embed the query using the same model\n",
    "- Find documents with embeddings most similar to the query embedding\n",
    "- Similarity is typically measured using cosine similarity or dot product"
