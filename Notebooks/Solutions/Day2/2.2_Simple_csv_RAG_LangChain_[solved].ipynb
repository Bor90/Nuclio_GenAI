    "# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying CSV documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# CSV File Structure and Use Case\n",
    "The CSV file contains dummy customer data, comprising various attributes like first name, last name, company, etc. This dataset will be utilized for a RAG use case, facilitating the creation of a customer information Q&A system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading and spliting csv files.\n",
    "2. Vector store creation using [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) and OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "3. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
    "4. Creating a question and answer over the csv data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The csv is loaded using langchain Csvloader\n",
    "2. The data is split into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.\n",
    "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A retriever is configured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.\n",
    "3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within a csv file."

    "## Introduction to LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, while demonstrating a RAG system, also serves as a practical introduction to [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). LangChain is a powerful open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain can be seen as a higher-level library that orchestrates the different components of a RAG system (and other LLM applications) in a more streamlined and modular way. Instead of writing boilerplate code to connect your data source, embedding model, vector store, and LLM, LangChain provides convenient abstractions to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using several LangChain components, which will be explained in more detail in the following sections."

    "\n",
    "The core of LangChain lies in its concept of 'chains'. Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. In our case, we want to create a retrieval-based question-answering chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_retrieval_chain` function is a helper function that simplifies the process of creating such a chain. It takes a retriever and a language model as input and creates a chain that first retrieves relevant documents from the vector store and then passes them to the language model to generate an answer. This is the essence of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern."
